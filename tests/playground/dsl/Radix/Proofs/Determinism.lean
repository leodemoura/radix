/-! # Determinism of Big-Step Semantics

Proof that the big-step semantics is deterministic: if a statement evaluates
to two results from the same state, those results must be equal.

The proof uses `grind` (SMT-style congruence closure and E-matching) for
cases that reduce to equational contradictions or functional injectivity,
and explicit inductive hypothesis application for recursive cases.
